Enjoy Looking at this ----> :)

## Quick Run Down

Most projects are linked to But some are Built into the website itself to avoided hosting simple projects.

There are links to email, github, linkedin, and a few coding websites I use.

### Future Ideas

I may added a backend so I can just upload projects directly to the site and track what skilld are used in what projects. Plus allow user to select a skill and show only those projects. Maybe even quick videos of the website so they don't have to leave. But that is for later if I have time.
